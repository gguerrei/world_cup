The analysis documents for the [World Cup Legacies: Abandoned Stadiums](https://world-cup-legacies.vercel.app/Brazil) project.

The project looks at the legacy of the World Cup in Brazil, focusing specifically on the stadiums built/renovated in preparation for the event. Investigating remaining debt figures and how often these stadiums are used, the project hopes to evaluate the real legacy of the event on the country.

These particular notebooks calculcate the number of tickets given away for free in select stadiums during the Brazilian 2023 regular soccer season. It also evaluates how much of each stadium was used. For this breakdown, the financial reports from each match were used. They can be found [here](https://www.cbf.com.br/futebol-brasileiro/competicoes/campeonato-brasileiro-serie-a/2023)

This code belongs to a larger set of data related to the legacy of World Cups in Brazil, Russia, and Qatar. This section was partitioned off to be used in a portfolio.

This project is currently in progress and awaiting publication. Do not under any circumstances share this repo or data with anyone.
